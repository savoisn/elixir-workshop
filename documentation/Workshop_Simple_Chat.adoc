= Elixir Phoenix Workshop

== What we will build

A very minimalistic version of a Chat App, with Phoenix
Features will include : 

- Minimalistic User Recognition
- Minimal (very very) Chat interface

NOTE: Let's dig in

== Create a Phoenix App - tag : creation

We will build an App called Slang, Sla for Slack, and ng because why not!?! +
The name of the app will be used in Module name, so if you want to be able to copy paste easily use `simple_chat` as App name

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.new *_folder_name_* --app simple_chat
----

It will generate a Phoenix Project in the folder specified
You will get asked to download dependencies, you can safely accept :D

=== A tour of the Generated Code

[source, subs="+quotes,+macros"]

----
Not too much spoiler, I will get in lengthy details :) Ask me for more during the workshop!

=== Run the project

First Create your database, and run the migrations
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
----

now let's open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/[^]

image::first_phoenix_screen.png[]

if you see something like that, you are on the right path fellow Alchemists :)

== User Schema Creation

We will use another code generator.
To generate a _Context_ to store our user information

Let's go : 
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.gen.context Chat User users name:string
----

Generated a bunch of stuff... first let's follow the instructions.

Run the migration (we won't use it very much but, for good measure...)

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix ecto.migrate
----

Let's take a look at the generated code : 

.lib/simple_chat/accounts/user.ex

- _lib/simple_chat/chat/user.ex_ +
  it's the code of our schema +
  one field, name +
  a helper fonction `timestamps()` to generated date fields for insert and update +
  a method `changeset(user, attr)` to process a changeset (a set of changes applied to the entity)
- _priv/repo/migrations/20190416054553_create_users.exs_ +
  the database migration to refleced the entity 
- _lib/simple_chat/chat.ex_ + 
  set of functions to help use our schema, create read update delete 
- _test/simple_chat/chat/chat_test.exs_ +
  the tests for `lib/simple_chat/chat.ex`

=== Template Modification

We our now set to _register_ a user +
We won't try to perform any kind of security - DON'T USE THAT IN PRODUCTION -

We will only store in the client session the name of our user.

To do that we will create a field in the HTML template of the first page phoenix has created for us : 

.lib/simple_chat_web/
[source, html, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
<section class="row">
  <article class="column column-67">
    <h2>My Beautiful Chat</h2>
    <%= form_for @changeset, Routes.page_path(@conn, :define_user), fn f -> %>
      <div>User : 
        <%= text_input f, :text %>
        <%= submit "Submit" %>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </article>
</section>
----

First it look like some HTML file with some templating in the middle. +
There's 4 lines that interest us in there with the special `<%= %>` notation +
it's simply the phoenix template notation, other language use `{{ }}` notation

let's begin with the most complicated the `form_for`
[source, elixir, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
    <%= form_for @changeset, Routes.page_path(@conn, :define_user), fn f -> %>
    ...
    <% end %>
----

This will create an HTML form.
As you may have notice, `form_for` is a function that take 3 arguments

- the `@changeset` will be filled with the changes in the differents html field for you.
- The `Routes.page_path(@conn, :define_user)` is a helper fonction that will return the url for the form 
- the `fn f -> ... end` is an anonymous function that will represent the field form itself


=== Controller Adaptation


let's go back to the browser -> http://localhost:4000/[^]

Oups, the browser is complaining, it's missing a `changeset`

let's add it in the controller managing this `page.eex` template

.lib/simple_chat_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
[source, elixir, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
defmodule SimpleChatWeb.PageController do
  use SimpleChatWeb, :controller

  alias SimpleChat.Chat.User

  def index(conn, _params) do
    changeset = SimpleChat.Chat.change_user(%User{})
    render(conn, "index.html")
  end
end
----

We first add an alias to the User Schema
and then we use the Chat Repo helper to get a `changeset`


=== Router Configuration

Grrr.... Phoenix is still complaining it says:

[source]
----
no function clause for SimpleChatWeb.Router.Helpers.page_path/2 and action :define_user. The following actions/clauses are supported:
----

This is because the Helpers function doesn't know the path. And for a good reason we didn't add it in the router ! Let's do that right now !

.lib/simple_chat_web/router.ex
[source, elixir, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
defmodule SimpleChatWeb.Router do
  use SimpleChatWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    plug(:accepts, ["html"])
    plug(:fetch_session)
    plug(:fetch_flash)
    plug(:protect_from_forgery)
    plug(:put_secure_browser_headers)
  end

  pipeline :api do
    plug(:accepts, ["json"])
  end

  scope "/", SimpleChatWeb do
    pipe_through(:browser)

    get("/", PageController, :index)
    *post("/", PageController, :define_user)*
  end

  # Other scopes may use custom stacks.
  # scope "/api", SimpleChatWeb do
  #   pipe_through :api
  # end
end
----

Ok the router is the place where each http request will be routed. +
It manage a Pipeline that request goes through. +
We see 2 pipelines described here, :browser and :api +
it's a list of *plug* that will handle operations and verifications on the http request (headers, jwt token, session, etc...)

Scopes are the place where we associate URL and a pipeline. +
The routing of the request based on that. +
It's like a pattern match with a Case statement but for http request. +
If one scope fails to apply the request is tried to all different scope of the router until it finds one matching route or returns as a failure (404 not found).

We just have to add our post route for the user to "define itself"
In the Scope "/" as show above in bold


Meanwhile in browser at http://localhost:4000/[^]

It's finally working !

image::user_login.png[]

=== Controller logic

We need to add this username into our session, so that the user can "feel" connected

Let's add the target function of the router (`:define_user`) to the controller

.lib/simple_chat_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  def define_user(conn, %{"user" => %{"text" => user}} = params) do
    changeset = SimpleChat.Chat.change_user(%User{})

    case user do
      "" ->
        conn
        |> put_flash(:error, "Username cannot be empty")
        |> render("index.html", %{user: nil, changeset: changeset})

      _ ->
        conn
        |> Plug.Conn.put_session(:user, user)
        |> render("index.html", %{user: user, changeset: changeset})
    end
  end
----

Don't be afraid, it's long but it's pretty simple.

This function takes 2 arguments:
- conn : which represent the http connection (request, response, header) +
  It has to be the return value of the function +
  You can't modify the one given in argument but you can create a new one, with the value modified
- params : it's the values of the fields in the format of a map, +
  with each key represented as a "String" +
  so you need to use the `%{"Key" => "Value"}` notation

Next we create a changeset that is the same as before

And then we check weither or not the user is defined or not - weither or not the user has entered it's name
We do that with a case on user, and pattern match weither the string is empty or not.

So if the string is an empty string, we add a flash message to the connection, to display the error to the user.

And if the username is not empty we add it to the session with the `Plug.Conn.put_session` function. +
This will return a new `conn` with the username set in the `:user` key.

In the end this will be added to the JWT token and passed as a cookie managed by phoenix to hold the session data, in a stateless manner.

We then `render` the `index.html` and pass some argument to the template.

=== Showing the user he is connected

If the user is connected we are going to hide the text field and button and show it's connection username and a disconnect button :

3 steps : 
- template to modify
- route to add for "disconnection"
- function in controller to handle "disconnection"


==== first the template

.lib/simple_chat_web/template/page/index.html.eex
[source, html, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
<section class="row">
  <article class="column column-67">
    <h2>My Beautiful Chat</h2>
    <%= if @user == nil do %>
      <%= form_for @changeset, Routes.page_path(@conn, :define_user), fn f -> %>
        <div>User : 
          <%= text_input f, :text %>
          <%= submit "Submit" %>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    <% else %>
      <input id="userName" type="hidden" value="<%= @user %>" />
        <div> Connected as <%= @user %>
          <%= link "Delete", to: Routes.page_path(@conn, :disconnect_user), method: :delete, class: "btn btn-danger btn-xs" %>
        </div>
    <% end %>
  </article>
</section>
----

We introduce logic in the template based on `@user` (which is the param passed to the view)

If the user is not present in the session we ask for a username

If the user is present, we display the username and a link to disconnect +
Note the method on the list - it's very usefull to respect the REST protocol

The hidden input will be used later for the javascript of the channel.


==== second the route in the router

.lib/simple_chat_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
[source, elixir, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
  scope "/", SimpleChatWeb do
    pipe_through(:browser)

    get("/", PageController, :index)
    post("/", PageController, :define_user)
    *delete("/", PageController, :disconnect_user)*
  end
----


==== third the controller

.lib/simple_chat_web/controllers/page_controller.ex
[source, elixir, subs="+quotes, +macros"]
----
  def index(conn, _params) do
    changeset = SimpleChat.Chat.change_user(%User{})
    *user = plug.conn.get_session(conn, :user)* <1>
    render(conn, "index.html", %{*user: user*, changeset: changeset})
  end

....

  def disconnect_user(conn, _params) do
    changeset = SimpleChat.Chat.change_user(%User{})

    conn
    |> Plug.Conn.delete_session(:user) <2>
    |> render("index.html", %{user: nil, changeset: changeset})
  end
----
<1> get the user from the session, and add it to the template render
<2> we disconnect the user by removing the key `:user` from the session


here you go http://localhost:4000/[^]:

== Le Chat en lui même

To handle communication between the differents users browser, Phoenix has Channel.

Let's create one : 

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.gen.channel Chat
----

Once again phoenix generates 2 files, one for implementation of the channel, and the second one for the tests.

Let's take a look at the channel code :


.lib/simple_chat_web/channels/chat.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
defmodule SimpleChatWeb.ChatChannel do
  use SimpleChatWeb, :channel

  def join("chat:lobby", payload, socket) do <1>
    if authorized?(payload) do 
      {:ok, socket}
    else
      {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
    end
  end

  # Channels can be used in a request/response fashion
  # by sending replies to requests from the client
  def handle_in("ping", payload, socket) do <2>
    {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket} <3>
  end

  # It is also common to receive messages from the client and
  # broadcast to everyone in the current topic (chat:lobby).
  def handle_in("shout", payload, socket) do 
    broadcast socket, "shout", payload <4>
    {:noreply, socket} <5>
  end

  # Add authorization logic here as required.
  defp authorized?(_payload) do 
    true
  end
end
----
<1> the function that is called when a new client connects
<2> the function that is called when a message is send to the channel.
<3> the response is a tuple +
it will `:reply` _something_ as a second parameter `another tuple` +
and last parameter is the `socket` +
like in controller function we have to return the socket. +
the response is for the caller only 1 to 1 communication.
<4> you can also broadcast to all client connected to the channel. +
Here we broadcast the payload with the message shout to every client connected to the channel
<5> in this case we don't reply anything... +
we already broadcasted to everyone... +
no need to make more noise !


But the channel we just described need to be handled some streams ! let's plug that

.lib/simple_chat_web/channels/chat.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----

defmodule SimpleChatWeb.UserSocket do
  use Phoenix.Socket

    ## Channels
    channel("chat:*", SimpleChatWeb.ChatChannel) <1>

		....

----
<1> here you go, any client channel that pushes messages to the the channel _chat:anything_

Now we have to generate a message entity

[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.gen.context Chat Message messages text:string sender:string
mix ecto.migrate
----

It generate same thing as previous generator, a schema and some helper function in the SimpleChat.Chat context


Ok we are ready to plug everything between the phoenix channel and the javascript of your html pages.

Phoenix comes in with a webpack project built in.
We can find it in the `assets` folder.
let's enable the javascript channel : 

.assets/js/app.js
[source,javascript,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
// Import local files
//
// Local files can be imported directly using relative paths, for example:
import socket from "./socket"; <1>
----
<1> uncomment this line to add it to the javascript build

.assets/js/socket.js
[source,javascript,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
let channel = socket.channel("*chat:lobby*", {}); <1>
channel
  .join()
  .receive("ok", resp => {
    console.log("Joined successfully", resp);
  })
  .receive("error", resp => {
    console.log("Unable to join", resp);
  });
----
<1> you have to specify a channel that maps the one described in `lib/simple_chat_web/channels/chat.ex`

let's look at the logs in the web page http://localhost:4000/[^]

you should see in the browser console something like that :

image::channel_connection.png[]

meaning the channel is open between your browser and your server!

Awesome let's put it to use !

.lib/simple_chat_web/templates/page/index.html.eex
[source,html,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
...
    _<% end %>_

    <div>
      <ul id="chatMessages">
        <li style="list-style-type:none">
          welcome to chat
        </li>
      </ul>

		</div>
    <div>
      <textarea id="myTextArea" col=100></textarea>
      <button onClick="sendMessage()">Send</button>
		</div>

  _</article>_
...
----
We had a list to hold the messages from other users +
A textArea for the message and a button to send the message

In the Javascript side it's more interesting

.assets/js/socket.js
[source,javascript,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
...
channel.on("new_message", payload => { <1>
  const ul = document.getElementById("chatMessages");
  const li = document.createElement("li");
  const textnode = document.createTextNode(
    payload.userName + " : " + payload.message
  );
  li.style.listStyleType = "none";
  li.appendChild(textnode);
  ul.appendChild(li);

});

let sendMessage = () => { <2>
  const msgBox = document.getElementById("myTextArea");
  const user = document.getElementById("userName");

  const msg = msgBox.value;
  const payload = {
    userName: user.value,
    message: msg
  };
  channel.push("message", payload); <3>
  msgBox.value = "";
};

window.sendMessage = sendMessage <4>

_export default socket;_ <5>
...
----

<1> on an inconnoming "new_message" we add it to the list
<2> we define a function to send message to the server for broadcasting
<3> we build a payload as a javascript object and push it through the channel
<4> make sendMessage function available to the html (I know it's dirty... but it's not the point to show nice Javascript...)
<5> don't remplace it, this line should already be there :D

Last part it to handle the new_message on the elixir channel side

.lib/simple_chat_web/channels/chat_channel.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
defmodule SimpleChatWeb.ChatChannel do
  use SimpleChatWeb, :channel

  def join("chat:lobby", payload, socket) do
    if authorized?(payload) do
      {:ok, socket}
    else
      {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
    end
  end

  def handle_in("message", payload, socket) do <1>
    broadcast(socket, "new_message", payload) <2>
    {:noreply, socket}
  end

  # Add authorization logic here as required.
  defp authorized?(_payload) do
    true
  end
end
----
<1> function to handle the "message" topic
<2> we rebroadcast the payload to all client +
don't do that in production... +
at least serialize deserialize the payload...

I've clean useless functions, ping and shout

And here we are the chat should be working http://localhost:4000/[^]!!

image::chat.gif[]

== Final Step : Who is Online - Phoenix Presence

Create a Presence with Phoenix generator
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
mix phx.gen.presence
----


this generate a presence file in the channel folder
mostly comment... 
.lib/simple_chat_web/channels/presence.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
...
  use Phoenix.Presence, otp_app: :simple_chat,
                        pubsub_server: SimpleChat.PubSub
... 
----
We start tell the Presence to use the app :simple_chat and to use our app PubSub server nothing to fear here :D

Add the Presence to your supervision tree as said in the command log :
.lib/simple_chat/application.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
    children = [
      # Start the Ecto repository
      SimpleChat.Repo,
      # Start the endpoint when the application starts
      SimpleChatWeb.Endpoint,
      SimpleChatWeb.Presence
      # Starts a worker by calling: SimpleChat.Worker.start_link(arg)
      # {SimpleChat.Worker, arg},
    ]
----
The supervision tree is the list of Process that compose the Phoenix application and that sould be restarted when thy crash 
This is where the `Let It Crash` Mojo is created



Now First add the minimum HTML to display the list of connected users

.lib/simple_chat_web/templates/pages/index.html.eex
[source,html,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
  _</article>_ //already exists

  <article class="column">
    <h2>User Connected</h2>
		<ul id="usersList">
		</ul>
  </article>
</section>
----
just a html empty list 

.assets/js/socket.js
[source,javascript,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
// Only the bold is to add to the `socket.js`
import { Socket, *Presence* } from "phoenix";

*const user = document.getElementById("userName");*
let socket = new Socket("/socket", {
  params: { token: window.userToken, *user_name: user.value* } <1>
});
...

// after the channel definition add this to enable presence:

let presence = new Presence(channel); <2>

let renderOnlineUsers = presence => { <4>
  let response = "";
  const ul = document.getElementById("usersList");

  ul.innerHTML = "";

  presence.list((user_name, { metas: [first, ...rest] }) => {
    let count = rest.length + 1;
    const li = document.createElement("li");
    const textnode = document.createTextNode(`${user_name} (count: ${count})`);
    li.appendChild(textnode);
    ul.appendChild(li);
  });
};

presence.onSync(() => renderOnlineUsers(presence)); <3>

----

<1> we had a new param to the data given to the socket when it connects to the server
<2> we create a Presence based on our channel
<3> on presence synchronisation we call the function renderOnlineUsers
<4> the presence will give us a list of users, for each user we have a <li> to our <ul> +
the presence will give us the username connected and the number of connection this username is connected to

We need to handle the new params that we added to the socket opening in `socket.js`
.lib/simple_chat/channels/user_socket.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
...
  def connect(params, socket, _connect_info) do
    {:ok, *assign(socket, :user_name, params["user_name"])*} <1>
  end
...
----
<1> the assign function return a new socket with the :user_name in the assigns of the socket.


Let's handle the presence in our Elixir Channel

.lib/simple_chat_web/channels/chat_channel.ex
[source,elixir,subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
defmodule SimpleChatWeb.ChatChannel do
  use SimpleChatWeb, :channel
  *alias SimpleChatWeb.Presence* <1>

  def join("chat:lobby", payload, socket) do
    if authorized?(payload) do
      *send(self(), :after_join)* <2>
      {:ok, socket}
    else
      {:error, %{reason: "unauthorized"}}
    end
  end

  def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do <3>
    push(socket, "presence_state", Presence.list(socket)) <4>

    {:ok, _} = <5>
      Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_name, %{ 
        online_at: inspect(System.system_time(:second))
      })

    {:noreply, socket}
  end
----
<1> we alias the previously created Presence
<2> we send a message to ourself for the function handling :after_join to be called
<3> function to handle to after_join message
<4> when a user in joining the Channel, we notify the Presence with the Socket
<5> we define what the presence shoud track here : the user_name from the socket _assigns_ (list of value attached to the socket - define in the params of the socket creation in the socket.js)
